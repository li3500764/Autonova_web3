# Autonova_web3

Autonova is a frontend-only, smart contract-based governance protocol designed for DAOs and decentralized communities. It enables gas-efficient proposal creation, voting, and execution entirely on-chain, eliminating the need for backend servers.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Frontend** - Includes:

   - Proposal dashboard (total count display)
   - AI-powered proposal creation (for administrators via DeepSeek)
   - Voting mechanism
   - Proposal display interface
   - Public fund visualization
2. **Smart Contracts** - Serve as the backend interface for the frontend

âœ¨ Coming soon: Full open-source release!
